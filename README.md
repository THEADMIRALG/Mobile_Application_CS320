Planning is one of the most important things to do in order to ensure your code is functional and secrue. Using techniques like static testing and going through a user story in depth to make 
sure all requirements are accounted for is a great start to make sure that the program will function as planned. This is also a great way to interperet user needs and making sure that all 
of their requirements are incorperated into the program. After putting a plan together for the project dynamic testing is a great way to make sure that any code produced going forward is fucntional 
and that no requirements were missed. Since testing is starting to become somewhat of a norm among developers, a lot of the planning for a project will include a test plan as well and even some test
development before the program starts production.
